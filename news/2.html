            <h2>Tips to choose high heels for girls</h2>
            <h4>Besides the shimmering outfits, surely she can't lack her favorite shoes. Maybe it's doll shoes, sports shoes, ... but maybe the girls will never equip themselves with beautiful shimmering high heels, right? So how to avoid foot pain or tripping
                from shoes that don't fit my feet as I thought? Let's share some tips when choosing high heels!</h4>
            <img src="/img/imgnews/k3.jpg" alt=""> <br>
            <br> 1. not all shoes are the same Of course they are not the same! But the measure here is in size. beautiful men's jacket Most girls who buy shoes usually remember one size of their own and choose for most, but sometimes stop working This
            is a mistake. For example, your feet can wear size 37 with round toe shoes, but when wearing pointed toe shoes, the narrow toe section makes your feet tight and you need size 38 for more comfort. So my suggestion is to always try on shoes
            if possible and understand your feet well. <br> 2. Regularly measure Another very important first line that women don't pay attention to, It's regular foot measurement. Don't think that your foot size will never change. Under the influence
            of the body, the weather, etc. It will grow or shrink. Better yet, measure your feet twice a year. This will help you always know your foot size so that choosing shoes becomes more convenient. <br> 3. Stand up straight It's very simple, when
            trying on shoes, stand up straight! This helps to spread your weight evenly on your feet, allowing for more accurate shoe testing. To make sure the shoes are really comfortable, walk around a bit to get the most authentic feel. <br> 4. Scales
            talk about width When choosing a pair of shoes, most women often only pay attention to the length and not much care about the width. Then you should give it a little extra attention because they are very important and greatly affect your appearance
            when you put your shoes on. If your feet are quite wide than usual, choose for yourself shoes with the W symbol on the back. For example, if you have wide feet and you go to size, choose to buy. With brands that do not have size, you can buy
            shoes that are half a size larger than usual. nice men's shirt. <br> 5.Give your feet space
            <br>

            <br> <br>

            <br>
            <br> A pair of shoes that fit well doesn't mean a couple of shoes that fit! The shoes you just put on are the things that when your feet are put on, you can still move your toes in a relaxed way. Shoes that fit well will make you feel uncomfortable
            and painful, especially when it comes to varied movements, varied standing and of course, running. To determine this tight fit, when trying on the shoe place a finger in the heel to see if your finger can easily slip in, and once it's in,
            it fits snugly around the heel and heel. yours? If you wear it, stop working. These are the shoes for you 7. Comfort is the best Don't let the fear of a few small feet make you grit your teeth and slip into a tight pair of shoes. It will affect
            your gait, posture and confidence, which is worse than most large feet. So, no matter how big your feet are, wear the right shoe size that you feel most comfortable with. at stop of construction. This beautiful men's t-shirt has a reputation
            for quality that has enough factors to grow into a brighter and more radiant person. <br> <br>
